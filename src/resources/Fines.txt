Fines:

- If a player lands on a plot owned by another player, they will be charged a fine.
- Players will be given the option of whether to pay the fine using their own money or by taking on CD from the owner.
- Fines are calculated based on the price of the plot and how many units are on that plot, as shown below:

Unit			Fine Calculation in £							Fine in Carbon Debt (CD)
----			----------------------							------------------------

Minor 			cost of minor unit + 1.5(number of units x cost of minor unit)		     1/5 of £ value 

Major 			5 x (cost of minor unit + 1.5(3 x cost of minor unit)) 			     1/5 of £ value


*all values rounded up if decimal value


Example Scenario:

Let's say a player lands on "Sunny Acres", which is owned by another player. Here's how fines are calculated based on the number of units present on the plot:

Number of units		Cost for Sunny Acres 		
---------------		---------------------				

	0 		-£20 or +4CD
	1		-£25 or +5CD
	2		-£40 or +8CD
	3		-£55 or +11CD
	major		-£275 or +55CD
