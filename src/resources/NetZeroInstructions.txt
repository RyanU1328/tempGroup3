Game Objective:

Net Zero is a strategic environmental conservation game designed for 2-4 players. Each player embarks on a journey to achieve "Net Zero" carbon emissions, competing against others to be the first to eliminate their Carbon Debt entirely.

At the beginning of the game, players have the opportunity to choose their avatar, representing their environmental commitment. Avatars include the cloud, lightning, sun, tree, and wave, each symbolizing different aspects of nature and renewable energy.

Players strategically invest in renewable energy properties across four fields: Wind, Solar, Hydroelectric, and Nuclear. By acquiring plots and developing them with both minor and major units, players can progressively reduce their Carbon Debt when another player lands on their plot. The other player will have the option to either pay a fine in money or accept Carbon Debt from the owner. This decision offers strategic choices for both the landing player and the property owner, affecting their financial and environmental standings in the game.

Net Zero challenges players to strategically invest in renewable energy properties, manage their finances effectively, and navigate the dynamics of fines and debt transfer to be the first to achieve environmental sustainability by reaching "Net Zero" carbon emissions. Choose your avatar wisely and embark on the journey to save the planet!

Game Setup:

- Choose the number of players and select an avatar for your game piece.
- Choose a unique username.
- Wait for all players to choose their avatars and confirm the number of players before starting.

Gameplay:

- The game begins with each player starting with £500 and 500 CD (carbon debt).
- Players take turns based on the order determined by rolling one 4-sided dice (d4). Player with the highest number goes first, with players moving sequentially.  Each player moves the number of squares equal to the sum of two 4-sided dice rolls.
- On your turn, players roll two 4-sided dice (d4) to move your token around the board.
- Land on unowned plots to purchase them.
- If you choose not to buy a plot, offer it to the next player in turn order.
- Develop your plots by adding minor units (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines) once you own all plots within a field (Solar, Wind, Hydroelectric, Nuclear).
- After adding three minor units, you can add one major unit (e.g. solar farms, wind farms), once this major unit has been added, this plot is complete.
- Gain £50 and reduce your CD by 10 each time you pass the "Go" space.
- Other players are fined each time they land on your plots, calculated based on plot value and unit development level.
- Choose to pay fines in money or transfer CD to the plot owner at a 5:1 ratio.
- The game continues until one player reaches 0 CD, becoming the winner.


Purchasing and Development:

- Minor units can be added based on the price of the unit for that plot.
- Players must own all plots within a theme before they can add units.
- Fines for landing on plots are based on plot value and unit development level (shown below).




Units:

Field			Minor Unit			Major Unit
-----			-----------			----------
Solar			Solar Panel 			Solar Farm

Wind			Wind Mill 			Wind Farm

Hydroelectric		Dam				Reservoir

Nuclear			Reactor				Plant



Upgrading:

- If you own all the plots in a field, you can upgrade by adding a unit, limited to one upgrade per turn.
- You can upgrade a plot on any turn, even if you have not landed on that plot.
- The price of a minor unit is half of the price of the plot.
- You can add 3 minor units before adding 1 major unit.
- Once a major unit is added, that plot is at maximum capacity.


Fines:

- If a player lands on a plot owned by another player, they will be charged a fine.
- Players will be given the option of whether to pay the fine using their own money or by taking on CD from the owner.
- Fines are calculated based on the price of the plot and how many units are on that plot, as shown below:

Unit			Fine Calculation in £							Fine in Carbon Debt (CD)
----			----------------------							------------------------

Minor 			cost of minor unit + 1.5(number of units x cost of minor unit)		     1/5 of £ value 

Major 			5 x (cost of minor unit + 1.5(3 x cost of minor unit)) 			     1/5 of £ value


*all values rounded up if decimal value


Example Scenario

Let's say a player lands on "Sunny Acres", which is owned by another player. Here's how fines are calculated based on the number of units present on the plot:

Number of units		Cost for Sunny Acres 		
---------------		---------------------				

	0 		-£20 or +4CD
	1		-£25 or +5CD
	2		-£40 or +8CD
	3		-£55 or +11CD
	major		-£275 or +55CD
