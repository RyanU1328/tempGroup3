Upgrading:

- If you own all the plots in a field, you can upgrade by adding a unit, limited to one upgrade per turn.
- You can upgrade a plot on any turn, even if you have not landed on that plot.
- The price of a minor unit is half of the price of the plot.
- You can add 3 minor units before adding 1 major unit.
- Once a major unit is added, that plot is at maximum capacity.
